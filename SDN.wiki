= Definition =

It introduces a layer or interface between the application layer and the Infrastructure layer. Traditionally the control is with each switch which uses some
routing algorithm like OSPF to determine the best path to send the packet through. Instead, in SDN there is a central control system that decides the path or
flow of the packets based on the requirements for the applications. This helps abstract the complex low-level commands that are used to achieve this goal.
By using high level languages in the control layer simple commands can achieve complex tasks.

= Uses =

* Centralising control which makes management and setup much easy.
* Network Optimisation
* Network Virtualisation

= Architectiore =

* Application Layer (North)
  - (North Bound Interface,NBI) (REST APIs used)
* (West) - Control Layer - (East)
  - (South Bound Interface,SBI) (Protocols like OPenFlow use)
* Infrastructure Layer (South)

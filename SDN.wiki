= Definition =

It introduces a layer or inerface between the application layer and the Infrastructure layer. Traditionally the control is with each switch which uses some
routing algorithm life OSPF to detrmin the best path to send the packet through. Instead, in SDN there is a central control system that decides the path or
flow of the packets based on the requirements for the applications. This helps abstract the coplex low-level commands that are user to achieve this goal.
By useing high level languages in the control layer simpal commands can achieve complex tasks.

= Uses =

* Centralising control which makes management and setup much easy.
* Network Optimisation
* Network Virtualisation

= Architectiore =

* Application Layer (North)
  - (North Bound Interface,NBI) (REST APIs used)
* (West) - Control Layer - (East)
  - (South Bound Interface,SBI) (Protocols like OPenFlow use)
* Infrastructure Layer (South)

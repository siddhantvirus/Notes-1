= Definition = 

It is a simulation application that can be used to make virtual networks and test our controller.

= Basic flags =

* --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 ( we can specify the controler that we are using )
* --mac ( So that the MAC addresses of the devices are human readable )
* -i 10.0.0.0/24 ( specify the subnet id )
* --switch=ovsk,protocol=OpenFlow13 ( We can specify what type of switch to use and what type of protocol to use to manage the Infrastructure layer )
* --topo=single,4 ( we can specify the topologies for the switches and the hosts )

= Basic Commands =

* net (Shows the various devices, their interfaces and which interface they are connected to )
* links ( shows which interface is connected to what interface )
* dump ( gives basic information of all the evices in the network like what is their ip address, interfaces and what protocol is the switch using )
* pingall ( here each host pings every other host )
* xterm <device name> ( it is used to launch a terminal in that device so that we can run commands in that device such as if config )
* <device name> <command> ( this is also used to run commands in a device if we dont care much about the output from the devices )

= Testing applications =

* iperf 
  - TCP
    h4<host name> iperf -s (this is run on a host to emulate a server)
    iperf -c 10.1.1.4<IP address of the server> -i 10 -t 30
    * -i <Number>(to specify the request interval)
    * -t <Number>(to specify the time for which the test will be run)
    * -P <Number>(We can use this flag to run parallel connections)
  - UDP
    For UDP we simply add the `-u` flag at the beginning after the `iperf` command and the remaning flags are exactly the same.
